PyBank:
During the PyBank assignment, I was able to gather data from a companies gains and losses during a specific timeframe. Using that information I displayed the total amount the company made, the average change throughout the months and finding which months had the greatest increase and decrease in profits. This took place over a 86 month timeframe and could be helpful information for the company to see what months were producing the greatest profit and losing them the most money. The overall profit came out to be $22.5million over the course of 86 months with August of 2016 being the greatest increase in revenue. 

PyRoll:
The PyRoll assignment was a way for me to gather data during an election. First I looked at the amount of total votes that were recieved amongst the three candidates. Then taking the total votes, I displayed how many votes each candidate got and their overall percentage compared to the others. This allowed me to see who had the most votes and how big a margin they won by. Diana DeGette was the overall winner receiving 272,892 votes which is 74% of the total votes.
